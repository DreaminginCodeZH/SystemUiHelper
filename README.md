## Why SystemUiHelper?

Android has introduced a lot of different API for controlling system UI visibility throughout its evolution. In order to simplify such complexity, `SystemUiHelper` categorized the possible behavior into `LEVEL_LOW_PROFILE`, `LEVEL_HIDE_STATUS_BAR`, `LEVEL_LEAN_BACK` and `LEVEL_IMMERSIVE`. Each one is pretty self explanatory.

## Why this library?

Although there have been [some other projects](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=SystemUiHelper) available, I created this library because this way I can always try to track the latest upstream changes. Third-party fixes are also welcomed to be incorporated.

This library has already included [a fix for delayed system UI visibility change](https://gist.github.com/chrisbanes/73de18faffca571f7292#gistcomment-1633712) from myself.

What's more, a sample application is given on how to use the `SystemUiHelper` with `Toolbar` from `appcompat-v7`.

## Integration

Gradle:

```gradle
compile 'me.zhanghai.android.systemuihelper:library:1.0.0'
```

## Usage

In `Activity.onCreate()`:

```java
mSystemUiHelper = new SystemUiHelper(this, SystemUiHelper.LEVEL_IMMERSIVE,
        SystemUiHelper.FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY,
        new SystemUiHelper.OnVisibilityChangeListener() {
            @Override
            public void onVisibilityChange(boolean visible) {
                ...
            }
        });
// This will set up window flags.
mSystemUiHelper.show();
```

You can refer to the sample app's [MainActivity](sample/src/main/java/me/zhanghai/android/systemuihelper/sample/MainActivity.java) for detail.
